              Regarding Flutter app development, I have professional experience

              and
              <strong>Riverpod</strong>. On the web development side of things,
              I have experience building user interfaces with pure <strong

              > and larger more interactive web apps using <strong
                >Svelte</strong
              >
              and <strong>Sveltekit</strong>.

              experience using <strong>MinIO</strong>, <strong>MySQL</strong> and
              other similar relational databases following the SQL standard.
